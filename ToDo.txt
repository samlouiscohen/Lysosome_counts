Objective:

1) Store all lysosome data in array from all images? (Markers for end of each image)
2)ratio of area between pink and blue (full image and dextrin) from the cleaned
3)Count lysosomes per cell - This may be much harder
	-May have to use an average if images are as poorly defined
	

Completed:

1) Read in images from multiple folders


2) Clean images for information collection

	a) Full-Cell clean
	b) Lysosomes clean 
	c) Dextrin clean
	d) (X) Cell Mask (X)        (May be impossible to fully clean)




3) Find pink area and dextrin area by individual components and get ratio (~66.2%)

4)Count objects within object - Algorithm works but Cell mask isnâ€™t defined



To Do:

1)Ensure that multiple images can be read with no damage to speed
2)Clean the cell mask
3)
