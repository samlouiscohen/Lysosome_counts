%Grab the count of lysosomes

img = imread("")


image_folder_dir = ['testImgs/sample' num2str(1)];
image_files = dir([image_folder_dir '/*.jpg']); %Should convert to png
lysosome_filename = [image_folder_dir '/' image_files(2).name];
lysosome_img = imread(lysosome_filename);
lysosome_clean = clean_lyso(lysosome_img);
[lyso_data, lyso_values, lyso_num] = collect_data(lysosome_clean, 'hi');


%Grab a single cell size (If possible, otherwise use a hardcoded value)
single_cell_size = 11463; %From "testPics/sample2/4.jpg"

%Calculate the area of the cellmask- trickiest part

    %Maybe count darker spots as overlaps so double area on these?
    %Area is calculated by multiplying local intensity by percieved area
    
    
    
    
   pink_area = sum(cat(1,pink_data.Area)); 
   
   
    
    
    
    
    
    
%Divide calculated area by lysosome count

%Return answer for the given frame
